# üìÉ Topics

# **some terms.. ;-;''**
- Early computers performed on single processor (*Uni-Processor or Monolithical Computing* which can be called as **Centralized Computing**)
- Independent computers are called **Loosely Coupled**.
- Service provided by a server on a network is called **Network Service**. üíÄ
- Application that runs on networked computers for end users.

# **Distributed System (DS) `?_?`**
- DS is a collection of independent computers, interconnected via network. Collaborating with each other to perform a task.
- It has no central point of failure ‚Äì if one machine stops working DS will not be affected.

# **Distributed Computing (DC) `?_?`**
- In simple words, Using multiple computers work together to solve a common problem.
- It provides large-scale resources to deal with complex challenges.
	- for ex: 
		- DC can encrypt large volume of data.
		- Solve physics & chemical equations with many variables.
		- Render high quality 3D Video animations.
- *Some other terms that all refer to DC*:
	- Distributed Systems
	- Distributed Programming
	- Distributed Algorithms
## Advantages
| **Advantages** | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Scalability*  | As users needs grow, they **can add more computing power to the system**. |
| *Availability* | It can **continue to operate** *even if some system fails*.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| *Consistency*  | Information is **shared and duplicated across all parts of the system**, and the *system manages this data consistently*, *allowing you to avoid errors and ensure reliability*.                                                                                                                      |
| *Transparency* | Users can interact with the *system as if it were a single computer*, regardless of how many *physical machines are involved*. They can *use different types of hardware, software, and operating systems together*.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| *Efficiency*   | The system **uses resources efficiently**, providing **fast performance** and *reducing the risk of system failure* due to high demand or low usage of the hardware.                                                                                                                                                                       |
