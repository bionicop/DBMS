# Q1(a) Under what circumstances would you choose Distributed DBMS over parallel DBMS?

| Advantage            | Description                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scalability          | Distributed databases can handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the system.   |
| Fault tolerance      | Data is replicated across multiple nodes, providing high availability and reliability.                              |
| Improved performance | Queries can be processed in parallel across multiple nodes, improving query performance.                            |
| Cost-effectiveness   | Distributed databases can run on common hardware, making them cost-effective.                                       |
| Data distribution    | Data can be distributed across multiple nodes, improving performance and reducing the risk of data loss.            |
| Easy maintenance     | Distributed databases can be designed to require minimal maintenance, as each node can be maintained independently. |
| Disaster recovery    | Data is replicated across multiple nodes, making it easier to recover from a disaster.                              |

# Q1(b) Compare and contrast different parallel Database Architectures?

| Architecture   | Description                                                                                      | Advantages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Shared Memory  | All nodes share a common memory space.                                                           | - *Fast data access and transfer between nodes* because of the *shared memory*.<br><br>- Simple and inexpensive to implement. <br><br>- Good for read-intensive workloads.                                                                            | - Limited scalability due to the shared memory constraint. <br><br>- Potential for memory discord and bottlenecks. <br><br>- Not suitable for large-scale systems.                                     |
| Shared Disk    | Each node has its own CPU and memory, but they all share access to a centralized storage system. | - High availability and fault tolerance, as each node can operate independently.<br><br>- Good for mixed workloads of read and write operations.<br><br>- Better scalability than shared memory architecture.                                         | - Higher complexity and cost than shared memory architecture.<br><br>- Potential for disk I/O bottlenecks and discord.<br><br>- May require more sophisticated database and system administration.     |
| Shared Nothing | Each node has its own CPU, memory, and storage, and they do not share any resources.             | - High scalability and performance, as each node can handle its own workload independently. <br><br>- Good for read-intensive and write-intensive workloads. <br><br>- High availability and fault tolerance, as each node can operate independently. | - Higher complexity and cost than shared memory architecture. <br><br>- Potential for network bottlenecks and contention. <br><br>- May require more sophisticated database and system administration. |
