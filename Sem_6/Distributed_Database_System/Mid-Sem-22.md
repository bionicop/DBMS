# Q1(a) Under what circumstances would you choose Distributed DBMS over parallel DBMS?
| Scenarios                 | DDBMS (Distributed DBMS)                                                                                                                                                                                | PDBMS (Parallel DBMS)                                                                                               |

| Geographical Distribution | Preferred choice when data is geographically distributed and needs to be accessed by users or applications in different locations.                                                                      | Not suitable for such scenarios, as it requires all data and processing to be done on a single machine.             |
| Scalability               | Designed to scale horizontally by adding more nodes, making it a better choice for applications requiring high scalability.                                                                             | Designed to scale vertically by upgrading the hardware of a single machine.                                         |
| Fault Tolerance           | Offers better fault tolerance than PDBMS, as it can replicate data across multiple nodes. <br><br>This redundancy ensures that the system keeps working even if one or more nodes fail.                 | May not offer the same level of fault tolerance as DDBMS, as it relies on a single machine for data and processing. |
| High Availability         | Can provide higher availability as it can continue operating even if some nodes fail.                                                                                                                   | May become unavailable if a single machine fails.                                                                   |
| Data Locality             | Can store data near the application or user requiring it, reducing latency and network traffic. <br><br>This is particularly important for applications demanding real-time or low-latency data access. | May not offer the same level of data locality as DDBMS, as it relies on a single machine for data storage.          |
| Complexity                | Can be more complex and challenging to manage than PDBMS.                                                                                                                                               | Generally easier to manage than DDBMS, as it relies on a single machine for data and processing.                    |

# Q2(a) How do you explain the improved performance of Distributed Database System?
1. Parallel Processing: DDS can divide data and queries among multiple nodes, enabling the simultaneous processing of data and queries across multiple nodes. This capability reduces overall processing time, as multiple nodes can work on different parts of a query or dataset concurrently.
2. Load Balancing: DDS can distribute the workload evenly across multiple nodes, preventing any single node from becoming a bottleneck. This ensures efficient resource utilization and optimizes overall system performance.
3. Data Locality: DDS can store data near the application or user requiring it, reducing latency and network traffic. This is particularly important for applications demanding real-time or low-latency data access.
4. Fault Tolerance: DDS can replicate data across multiple nodes, ensuring system availability even in the event of node failures. This redundancy can also enhance overall system performance by enabling queries to be processed on multiple nodes simultaneously.
5. Scalability: DDS can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the system, increasing capacity and performance.
