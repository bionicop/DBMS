# Psychology of Testing
- Type of testing which depends on the psychology & mindset of developers & tester.
- Goal is to ensure that testing process is impartial, unbiased, & focus on identifying issues with the software.
- Test cases can be developed by:
	- Developers themselves - Though it can lead to biasness.
	- By other peoples - Introduces a fresh perspective.
	- By Specialists - Specialists can bring a high level of expertise.
	- By External parties - Provides unbiased assessment.

# Verification & Validation
## Verification
- Process of ensuring that software meets its specifications. This means checking that the software does what it is supposed to do, according to the requirements document.
- In simple terms: **"Are we building the *product right*?"**
- Verification is performed at early stage of development.
- Verification activities are typically performed statically, meaning that the software is not executed.

## Validation
- Process of ensuring that software meets the needs of its users. This means checking that the software is useful, usable, and satisfies the user's expectations.
- In simple terms: **"Are we building the *right product*?"**
- Validation activities are typically performed dynamically, meaning that the software is executed and tested with real-world data and scenarios.

- `Testing = Verification + Validation`

# Software Testing
- Process of identifying the correctness, completeness, & overall quality of a developed software.
- Involves execution of program under both positive & negative conditions, can be done using tools or manually.
- Primary focus is to check:
	- Specification: Software should meet it's requirement.
	- Functionality: Software functioning as intended.
	- Performance: Software's speed, scalability, & resource usage.
- Goals of Software testing: `#FIRM`
	1. **F**_ind Issues_: Identify and report bugs, errors, and issues in the software.
	2. **I**_mprove Quality_: Enhance the overall quality and reliability of the software.
	3. **R**_educe Risks_: _Minimize the **chances of software failures**_ or issues in real-world usage.
	4. **M**_aintain Performance_: Ensure that the software functions efficiently and effectively under different conditions.
# Error, Bug, Fault & Failure
## Error
- Mistake made by developer in code/design.
## Bug
- Error at the time of execution of the software.
## Fault
- Defect in the code introduced due to an error.
## Failure
- Deviation of software from delivering expected functionality due to fault.
