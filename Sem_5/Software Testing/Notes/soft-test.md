# Verification & Validation
## Verification
- Process of ensuring that software meets its specifications. This means checking that the software does what it is supposed to do, according to the requirements document.
- In simple terms: **"Are we building the *product right*?"**
- Verification is performed at early stage of development.
- Verification activities are typically performed statically, meaning that the software is not executed.

## Validation
- Process of ensuring that software meets the needs of its users. This means checking that the software is useful, usable, and satisfies the user's expectations.
- In simple terms: **"Are we building the *right product*?"**
- Validation activities are typically performed dynamically, meaning that the software is executed and tested with real-world data and scenarios.

- `Testing = Verification + Validation`
