### Simultaneous Assignments
- Performing simultaneous assignments to multiple variables in a single statement.

### Named Constants
- Declaring and using named constants in Python programs.

### Numeric Data Types and Operators
- Exploring numeric data types (integers, floats) and their operations in Python.

### Evaluating Expressions and Operator Precedence
- Understanding how expressions are evaluated and how operator precedence impacts the order of operations.

### Augmented Assignment Operators
- Using augmented assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) to update variable values.

### Type Conversions and Rounding
- Converting between data types in Python. Rounding numerical values.
