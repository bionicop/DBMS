Q2 (a) When transferring a file between two computers, (at least) two acknowledgement strategies are possible. In the first one, the file is chopped up into packets, which are individually acknowledged by the receiver, but the file transfer as a whole is not acknowledged. In the second one the packets are not acknowledged individually, but the entire file is acknowledged when it arrives. Discuss these two approaches.
