An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem.

There is an **input**, and then there's an **algorithm**, *the algorithm is a set of rules* the program follows to produce the **output**.

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[Input] --> B[Algorithm: <br>Validates whether the input follows the rules.]
    B -->|Valid| C[Output: If it does then good.]
    B -->|Invalid| D[Output: Neither error message will be given.]

```
