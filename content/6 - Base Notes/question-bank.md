# Course: Relational Database Management System
*Max: 60 Marks*

**Q**.1 Answer the following questions. (Any THREE)

*A)* UPS prides itself on having up-to-date information on the processing and current location of each shipped item. To do this, UPS relies on a company-wide information system Shipped items are the heart of the UPS product tracking information system. Shipped items can be characterized by item number (unique), weight, dimensions, insurance amount, destination, and final delivery date. Shipped items are received into the UPS system at a single retail center. Retail centers are characterized by their type, uniquelD, and address. Shipped items make their way to their destination via one or more standard UPS transportation events (ie., flights, truck deliveries). These transportation events are characterized by a unique schedule Number, a type (eg. flight, truck), and a delivery Route.

Draw an Entity Relationship diagram that captures this information about the UPS system. Be certain to indicate identifiers and cardinality constraints.

*B)* Consider the relational database and write a relational algebraic query for each of the following:

```
branch(branch name, branch city, assets)
customer(customer name, customer street, customer city)** names may not be
unique**
loan(loan number, branch name, amount) ** assume that loan numbers are across all branches
borrower customer name, loan number)
account(account number, branch name, balance)
depositor(customer name, account number)
```
Foreign Keys: 
- loan and account have foreign key branch name for branch. 
- borrower has foreign key loan number for loan.
- depositor has foreign key account number for account. 
*i.* Find the names of all branches located in 'Chicago".
*ii.* Find the names of all borrowers who have a loan in branch 'Down-town".
