Subject: [[Content Management System]]
## What is a CMS?
It's a software that is designed to create, manage and modify *digital content* on the website, without the need of using advance technical knowledge. With CMS we do not require to write code, well we do but not from scratch, CMS usually have user-friendly interface. Their are many modules/extensions presents in the CMS which we can utilise to solve and create something.

## Examples of CMS are:
- **[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)**: WP's probably the most famous out of all and you probably have heard about it. It's an amazing CMS which has a very huge community and extensive plugin libraries. WP's is used by a lot of big companies around the globe for ex:
	- The Walt Disney Company
	- jQuery
	- The White House
	- Wired
	- TED Blog, and [*many more*](https://wpclipboard.com/famous-brands-companies-using-wordpress/)...

- **[Drupal](https://drupal.org/)**: [[Drupal]] is also a very famous CMS, which is know for it's robust *security and scalability*. It uses modular architecture, meaning it is built upon collection of *independent modules* that allows developers to customize and extend the functionality of their websites easily. Each module can handle specific tasks, enabling users to create everything from simple sites to complex web applications without compromising performance or security. Some companies that are using this CMS for their websites are:
	- Tesla
	- Nokia
	- Oxford University
	- NASA, and *[many more](https://smartbees.co/blog/who-uses-drupal-20-famous-drupal-websites)*...
