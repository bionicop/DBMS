# Introduction to computer network
Subject: [[Fundamentals of Computer Networking]]

I hope these notes can make your journey of learning "*Computer Networking*" a fun ride, I will try to make these notes as thorough and intricate so that you can get essential concepts that supports the operation of networks.

## 🎯 What's This All About?
Ok, so let's imagine you are trying to send a message to your friend who is living very far or even other side of the world, How does that message travel across in a blink of an eye (*depends on the internet speed but you know what I am trying to say.*), That's the magic of "Networking!" In these notes we'll try to see how this magic works o.O

> - **Protocols**: The "languages" computers use to talk to each other
> - **Network Architecture**: How all the pieces fit together
> - **Security**: Keeping our digital interactions safe
> - **And *much more*!**

## 🧠 Overwhelmed?
Feeling a bit **overwhelmed**? *you should be*! All you need is, **Ph. D. in Computer Science** and.... Nah just kidding you don't need to even know about computers💀yha all you need is:
- A curious mind
- Willingness to learn

## 💡 Why Should You Even Care?

It's like having a superpower in our connected world. Here's why it's awesome:
