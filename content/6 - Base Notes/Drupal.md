# Drupal
Subject: [[Content Management System]]

Drupal is an ***open-source content management system*** that is highly flexible, customizable, powerful, and scalable CMS. It is well-suited for developing complex websites.

## WHY drupal?
Well, It's a modular based, which means you can add or remove features based on your need, without compromising the core system. It's highly customisable(*so are others*) but... *what sets Drupal apart is its robust modular architecture*, allowing for tailored functionalities **without constraints**. Additionally, Drupal excels in **scalability**; it can *handle high traffic and complex content structures*, making it ideal for everything from small blogs to large enterprise applications. It also has a strong community support and extensive library of modules ensure your site can evolve as your requirements grow.

That gives us a basic of [[drupal]]. Now let's move on to implementation shall we get started.

1. College website
