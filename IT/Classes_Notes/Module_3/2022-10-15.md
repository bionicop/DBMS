## **XML vs HTML**
| **XML**                                                                                                                 | **HTML**                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| XML is a **software and hardware independent tool** used to _transport and store data_. It ==focuses on what data is==. | HTML is used to **display data** and _focuses on how data looks_. |
| Case sensitive.                                                                                                         | Case insensitive.                                                 |
| You can defines your own tags.                                                                                          | Predefined tags.                                                  |
| Mandatory to use a closing tag.                                                                                         | Not necessary to use a closing tag.                               |
| It is **dynamic** because it is used to _transport data_.                                                               | It is **static** because it is used to _display data_.            |
| It **Preserve whitespaces**.                                                                                            | It does **not** _preserve whitespaces_.                           |
