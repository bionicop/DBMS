## **What is the Internet?**
- The Internet is a vast network that connects¬†[computers](/Side_Notes/computer.md)¬†all over the world
- Computers in a network capable of sharing resources (memory, peripherals).
- Internet is **Dectenralized** by *design*.
- Each Internet computer, called a **host**, is *independent*.
- *Most users* get access to the internet through An **Internet Service Provider** (ISP). 

## **Types Of Internet Connections**

### Dial-Up
- Dial-up connections require users to link their **phone line** to a *computer* in order to access the Internet.
- It does not permit users to ==make or receive phone calls== through their¬†home phone service¬†*while using the Internet*.
- Dial-up access is *cheap* **but slow.**
- It ranges from **28K** to **56K**.

### DSL
- DSL stands for¬†**Digital Subscriber Line**.
- DSL uses existing *2-wire copper telephone line* connected to one's home so service is *delivered at the same time* as landline telephone service.
- DSL is a form of ==broadband communication== that is always **"on"**.
- Customers can *still place calls while surfing the Internet*.
- It ranges from **128K** to **8 Mbps**.

### Cable
- Cable *provides acess* to the internet through ==cable TV lines==.
- There are *different speeds* depending on if you are **uploading data transmissions** or **downloading**.
- It is a form of *broadband access cable modem* that can provide **extremely fast access** to the internet.
- It ranges from **512K** to **20 Mbps**.

### Wireless
- The wireless connection uses a **radio frequency** band to c*onnect to the internet*.
- Wireless is also an always on connection and it can be accessed from just about anywhere
- Wireless is also an **always "on" connection** and it can be *accessed from just about anywhere(speed may vary for different locations)*.
- It ranges from **5 Mbps** to **20 Mbps**.

### Satellite
- Satellite accesses the internet via a satellite in Earth‚Äôs orbit.
- The *enormous distance* that a signal travels from earth to satellite and back again, provides a **delayed connection** compared to *cable and DSL*.
- It ranges from **512K** to **2.0 Mbps**.
 
### Cellular
- Cellular technology *provides wireless Internet access* through **cell phones**.
- The speeds vary *depending on the provider*, but the *most common* are **3G** and **4G speeds**.
- *3G* is for *third-generation wireless* cellular network, speeds is around **2.0 Mbps**.
- *4G* is the *fourth-generation wireless* cellular network, speeds of *100Mbps* but the reality is about **21Mbps** currently.
- It ranges from **512K** to **2.0 Mbps**.

## **Modem**
- Modem stands for **Modulator** and **Demodulator**.
- Device that enables a computer to *transmit data over* **telephone or cable lines**.
- Converts a *computer‚Äôs digital signals* into *specific frequencies* to ==travel over telephone or cable television lines==.
- A *modem transmits data* in **Bits Per Second (bps)**.

### **Internal and External Modem**
| **Internal Modem**                                                                                                                                                                        | **External Modem**                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| As the name suggests _internal modem_ is an **internal part inside a computer**. It usually comes with the *computer pre-installed*. It can be **powered** using the ==computer's own power supply.== | An external modem is similar to the internal modem in that it also allows access to the Internet, but *unlike the internal modem*, The _external modem_ **sits outside** the computer.       |
| It takes _one_ of the **expansion slots**.                                                                                                                                                  | The **modem typically connects** to the computer *via a serial or USB cable*, and is ==usually powered by an external source==, *rather then the computer*.                                      | 

### **Characteristics of Modem**

#### Speed Of Transmission
- At *slow rates* modems are measured in terms of **baud rates**. 
- At *higher speeds* modems are measured in terms of **bits/sec**.

#### Modes supported
- Support a *switch to change* between **voice** and **data modes**. 
	- Data mode ‚Äì Regular modem. 
	- Voice mode ‚Äì Regular telephone.

#### Auto-answer
- Enables to *receive your calls* in **your absence**.

#### Data Compression
- Some modems perform data compression, which enables them to send **data at faster rates**. *However*, the modem at the *receiving end must* be able to ==decompress the data using the same compression technique==.

#### Flash Memory
- *Communication protocols* can be **easily updated**.

#### Fax Capability
- *Can* **send** and **receive faxes**.

## **Standards Of Data Communication**

### **CCIT**
- CCIT *stands for* **Consultative Committee for International Telephony and Telegraphy**.
- Organization that sets *International commmunication standards* example-
	- Group 3 - *Universal protocol* for **sending fax** documents ==across telephone lines==.
	- Group 4 - Over [*ISDN network*](#).
	- V.21 , V.22, V.29 *etc*

---
## **ISDN Connection**
- ISDN *stands for* **Integrated Services Digital Network**.
- ISDN is a *telephone network based infrastructure* that allows the *transmission of* ==voice, video and data simultaneously at a high speed with greater efficiency==.
- ISDN connection has some *B-channel* (**Bearer-channel**) which are the **main data channel** & *D-channel* (**Delta-channel**) which ==carries control and signaling information==.

### Types of ISDN
- **Basic Rate Interface** (*BRI*) 
	- It is made up of 2 B-channels , at **64 Kbit/s**¬†and 1 D-channel, at **16¬†Kbit/s**.
	- **2 B-chnanel** *64-Kbits* and **1 D-channel** *16¬†Kbits*.
- ### **Primary Rate Interface** (*PRI*)
