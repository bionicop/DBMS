## **What is the Internet?**
- The Internet is a vast network that connects¬†[computers](Side_Notes/computer.md)¬†all over the world
- Computers in a network capable of sharing resources (memory, peripherals).
- Internet is **Dectenralized** by *design*.
- Each Internet computer, called a **host**, is *independent*.
- *Most users* get access to the internet through An **Internet Service Provider** (ISP). 

## **Types Of Internet Connections**

### Dial-Up
- Dial-up connections require users to link their **phone line** to a *computer* in order to access the Internet.
- It does not permit users to ==make or receive phone calls== through their¬†home phone service¬†*while using the Internet*.
- Dial-up access is *cheap* **but slow.**
- It ranges from **28K** to **56K**.

### DSL
- DSL stands for¬†**Digital Subscriber Line**.
- DSL uses existing *2-wire copper telephone line* connected to one's home so service is *delivered at the same time* as landline telephone service.
- DSL is a form of ==broadband communication== that is always **"on"**.
- Customers can *still place calls while surfing the Internet*.
- It ranges from **128K** to **8 Mbps**.

### Cable
- Cable *provides acess* to the internet through ==cable TV lines==.
- There are *different speeds* depending on if you are **uploading data transmissions** or **downloading**.
- It is a form of *broadband access cable modem* that can provide **extremely fast access** to the internet.
- It ranges from **512K** to **20 Mbps**.

### Wireless
- The wireless connection uses a **radio frequency** band to c*onnect to the internet*.
- Wireless is also an always on connection and it can be accessed from just about anywhere
- Wireless is also an **always "on" connection** and it can be *accessed from just about anywhere(speed may vary for different locations)*.
- It ranges from **5 Mbps** to **20 Mbps**.

### Satellite
- Satellite accesses the internet via a satellite in Earth‚Äôs orbit.
- The *enormous distance* that a signal travels from earth to satellite and back again, provides a **delayed connection** compared to *cable and DSL*.
- It ranges from **512K** to **2.0 Mbps**.
 
### Cellular
- Cellular technology *provides wireless Internet access* through **cell phones**.
- The speeds vary *depending on the provider*, but the *most common* are **3G** and **4G speeds**.
- *3G* is for *third-generation wireless* cellular network, speeds is around **2.0 Mbps**.
- *4G* is the *fourth-generation wireless* cellular network, speeds of *100Mbps* but the reality is about **21Mbps** currently.
- It ranges from **512K** to **2.0 Mbps**.


## Some Basic Notes
1. We should write down our code on the Scilab editor notes.
	- **WHY** you *ask*?
	- *well, typing directly into console has TWO disadvantages.*
		1. It is **NOT** possible to save command.
		2. It is **NOT** easy to edit multiple lines of instruction.
