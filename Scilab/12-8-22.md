#### Addition using two variables-
*Input-*
```scilab
//Addition using two variables
a = 69;
b = 420;
ans1 = a+b;
```

*Output-*
```scilab
 a  = 
   69.
 b  = 
   420.
 ans1  = 
   489.

  "Execution done."
```

#### Subtraction using two variables-
*Input-*
```scilab
//Addition using two variables
a = 69;
b = 420;
ans1 = a+b;
```

*Output-*
```scilab
 c  = 
   69.
 d  = 
   420.
 ans2  = 
  -351.

  "Execution done."
```

#### Multiplication using two variables-
*Input-*
```scilab
//Multiplication using two variables
e = 69;
f = 420;
ans3 = e * f;
```

*Output-*
```scilab
 e  = 
   69.
 f  = 
   420.
 ans3  = 
   28980.

  "Execution done."
```

#### Division using two variables-
*Input-*
```scilab
//Division using two variables
g = 9;
h = 3;
ans4 = g / h
```

*Output-*
```scilab
 ans4  = 
   3.

  "Execution done."
```

#### Matrix Addition using two variables-
*Input-*
```scilab
//Matrix Addition using two variables
i = [1, 2, 3] // "," means row.
k = [4, 5, 6]
ans5 = i + k
```

*Output-*
```scilab
 i  = 
   1.   2.   3.
 k  = 
   4.   5.   6.
 ans5  = 
   5.   7.   9.

  "Execution done."
```

#### Matrix Multiplcation using two variables-
*Input-*
```scilab
//Matrix Multiplcation using two variables
l = [1, 2, 3]
m = [4 ; 5 ; 6] // ";" means column.
ans6 = l * m
```

*Output-*
```scilab
 l  = 
   1.   2.   3.
 m  = 
   4.
   5.
   6.
 ans6  = 
   32.

  "Execution done."
```

#### Matrix Addition using two variables-
*Input-*
```scilab
//Matrix Addition using two variables
i = [1, 2, 3]
k = [4, 5, 6]
ans5 = i + k
```

*Output-*
```scilab
 i  = 
   1.   2.   3.
 k  = 
   4.   5.   6.
 ans5  = 
   5.   7.   9.

  "Execution done."
```

- Class defines the blueprint of *Objects*. They define the properties and functionalities of the objects. *ex- Laptop is a ‚Äúclass‚Äù and your laptop is an ‚Äúinstance‚Äù of it.*

#### Object 
- Object is an instance of a *Class.* It contains properties and functions. They are like real-world objects, *ex- pen, chair, house, laptop, etc* are all objects. They have some specific properties and methods to perform some action.
