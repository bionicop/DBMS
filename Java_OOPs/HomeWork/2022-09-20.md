## **Answers-**

# 1
  *Explain Java Features.*
	  ## **Platform Independent** -
		  - *Compiler converts source code* to **bytecode** and then the *[JVM](#JVM) executes the bytecode* generated by the compiler.
		  - This **bytcode** can run on any device. Each OS has a *different [JVM](#JVM)*, but the ==output produced by all the OS is the same after the execution of bytecode==.
		  - This is why Java is called **platform-independent**. 
			  - The¬†programs written in Java *can be run on multiple platforms* *without re-writing them individually* for a particular platform.
	  ## **Simple** - 
		  - It is one of the ***easy-to-use*** programming languages *to learn*.
		  - Java's syntax is based on "*C++*" (*so easier for programmers to learn it after C++*).
		  - Java has **removed** many *complicated and rarely-used features*, 
			  - *Example-* explicit pointers, operator overloading, *etc.*
		- There is *no need* to r==emove unreferenced objects== because there is an **Automatic Garbage Collection in Java**.
	  ## **Object-oriented** - 
		  - *Everything in Java* is an **object**. 
		  - Object-oriented means *we organize our software* as a ==combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior==.
		  - Basic concepts of OOPs are:
			  1. [[Object_Oriented_Programming#^edbd1a|Object]]
			  2. [[Object_Oriented_Programming#^3ccd44|Class]]
			  3. Inheritance
			  4. Polymorphism
			  5. Abstraction
			  6. Encapsulation
	  ## **Secured** - 
		  - Java is best known for its *security*. With Java, we can develop *virus-free systems*. 
		  - Java programs run in an environment that is *independent of the os environment* ==which makes java programs more secure==.
		  - Java is secured because:
			  - *No explicit pointer*.
			  - Java Programs run inside a *virtual machine sandbox*.
	  ## **Robust** - 
		  - Java is a robust language that *can handle run-time errors as it checks* the code *during the compile and runtime*.
		  - If any *runtime error* is identified by the *JVM*, it will **not be passed directly** to the *underlying system*. Instead, it will *immediately* **terminate the program** and ==stop it from causing any harm to the system==.
		  - The *main features* of java that make it robust are **garbage collection, Exception Handling, and memory allocation**.
	  ## **Portable** - 
	  - Java Byte code can be carried to any platform
  - It is designed for building **object-oriented applications**.
  - It is a **multithreaded language** *with automatic memory management*.
