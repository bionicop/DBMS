| XML Schema is a more modern and powerful way to define the structure and constraints of an XML document.                           	| DTD is an older and simpler way to define the structure and constraints of an XML document.                    	|
| XML Schema uses XML syntax to define the structure, data types, and validation rules of XML documents.                             	| DTD uses a markup language with its own syntax to define the structure and validation rules of XML documents.  	|
| XML Schema supports complex data types, such as strings, numbers, dates, and custom data types.                                    	| DTD has limited support for data types and validation, and does not support complex data types.                	|
| XML Schema allows for namespaces, which enables better organization and management of XML documents.                               	| DTD does not support namespaces, which can make organization and management of XML documents more challenging. 	|
| XML Schema provides support for data binding and code generation, making it easier to work with XML data in programming languages. 	| DTD does not provide built-in support for data binding or code generation.                                     	|
