# **Introduction**

## **What is Software Engineering?**
- Software¬†is *more than just a program code*.
- On the other hand Engineering is all about *developing products, using well-defined, scientific principles and methods*.
- Thus, It's a *systematic collection* of good program development **practices and techniques**. (An *engineering approach* to *develop a software*.)
- From above points of view we can define Soft Eng as:
	- Soft Eng discusses *systematic & cost-effective* techniques for Software Development. It is *an engineering approach to develop software*.

# *is* **Software Engineering Art or Science?**
- Many people think writing good quality code is an Art. So let's discuss about this:
	- In other engineering branches It is based on science there are *specific rules & names for the components, techniques* & working principles related to it & before they are *standardized the experience is marked as* their **Thumb Rule** and on the basis of it, *the rules are standardized by various organizations*.
	- Likewise in Soft Eng there is *heavy use of knowledge* which comes from **experience of practitioners**, & *well organizations or resarcher's made systmeatically organzied* the experience in ***thoeritical form***.
	- Thus, like any other Engineering Disciplines, *Soft Eng is a "Science" that is **transformed from "Art"***.

# **Program** *vs* **Product**
|                                                 **Program**                                                 	|                                                               **Product**                                                               	|

| Program contains a _set of instructions_ ==designed to complete a specific task==.                          	| Product is the _final manufacture and production of the project_.                                                                       	|
| It is a _passive entity as it resides in the secondary memory_.                                             	| It is an _active entity_ as it is made again and again for the _purpose of distribution to users_.                                      	|
| It exists at a single place and continues to exist until it is deleted.                                     	| A product can _exist for a long period of time as long as it is tested for better **performance and durability**_.                      	|
| It can be made in relatively **shorter** period of _time_.                                                  	| It needs a **lot of time** to be made. There are several stages (_design, coding, testing, maintenance_ etc.) to form a product.        	|
| It is handled by the **Program Managers**.                                                                  	| It is handled by **Product Managers**.                                                                                                  	|
| _Resource requirement isn't necessary_, it only requires **memory space** for ==storing the instructions==. 	| It needs human, technology and time resources to be functional.                                                                         	|
| The _main focus_ of the program is whether it is giving a **specific desired output or not**.               	| The main focus of a product is its _capability to solve the **problem** that it was made for_.                                          	|
| There are _no concrete guidelines_ in writing a program.                                                    	| In case of product, the firm **guidelines are followed**.                                                                               	|
| It _may or may not focus on efficiency and cost_.                                                           	| It needs to _worry about the **cost and efficiency**_ as it would ==affect the profitability of the enterprise launching the product==. 	|
