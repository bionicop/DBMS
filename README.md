# Description
This repository contains notes from my colleges, organized into separate branches. You can easily switch between branches to access the notes specific to each college or you can visit the [github pages](https://bionicop.github.io/Digital-Garden/) for my repository where I am trying to keep everything organised and clean.


## Branches Overview
- **[BCA](https://github.com/bionicop/Digital-Garden/tree/bca(not-completed))**: This branch contains all the notes from BIT college where I did my BCA (They are not yet completed, I need to refactor and merge a lot of documents so yha they are not yet completed...).
- **[MSc(CA)](https://github.com/bionicop/Digital-Garden/tree/v4)**: This branch contains all the notes from Symbiosis, I am still studing as of now so these notes will get updated frequently.

## How to View Notes
1. Click on the links above to navigate directly to the respective branch.
2. Once on the branch page, you can view the files and folders containing the notes.

or you can view by visiting my [github pages](https://bionicop.github.io/Digital-Garden/) (tho, it only has MSc(CA) notes only. I haven't added my bca notes to it yet, so sorry about that ;-;)
