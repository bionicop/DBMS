# Escaping [I learned about this preety late & this is the only reason I am making these cheatnote/cheatsheet it is a Game Changer ngl.]

	## 1st Way:
		[Some Heading](#some%heading) [Important thing here is if you have spaces between your headings that you are trying to link in same document as a Index then you have to 1st Write heading in lowercase & 2nd have "%20" when there is some space.]

	## 2nd Way:
		Or you could completely skip that by doing:
		[Some Heading](<#Some Heading>) [Here, you have to just add "<" at the start of your heading & this ">" at the end of your heading, & this is "Case-Insensitive" so you don't have to re-write your heading in lowercase good innit?]
