## Object-Oriented Programming
- It is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
- *Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming-*

#### Classes
- Class defines the blueprint of *Objects*. They define the properties and functionalities of the objects. *ex- Laptop is a “class” and your laptop is an “instance” of it.* ^3ccd44

#### Object 
- Object is an instance of a *Class.* It contains properties and functions. They are like real-world objects, *ex- pen, chair, house, laptop, etc* are all objects. They have some specific properties and methods to perform some action. ^edbd1a
